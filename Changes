        - Fix function name (GH#5).

        - Add ta_set_state() and ta_state_to_code() to fix ta_highlight()

	- [bugfix][function ta_wrap] Fix handling of flindent & slindent
	  options (GH#1).


0.232   2021-04-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] Add FAQ item about the reason for splitting functionalities
	  over modules/distributions.


0.231   2021-01-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- ta_wrap, ta_mbwrap: Add option keep_trailing_space.

	- [doc] Mention some related modules.


0.230   2019-04-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Spelling [RT#129226].


0.22    2016-03-11  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Removed features] Remove Text::ANSI::NonWideUtil (ugly name), but
          remove wide-character supporting functions (ta_mb*()) in
          Text::ANSI::Util.


0.21    2015-08-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] Add some description and mention Text::ANSI::WideUtil.


0.20    2015-08-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Split Text::ANSI::WideUtil to its own dist.

        - Re-pass tests [RT#106535].


0.19    2015-08-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Adjust abstract and documentation. We now only deal with ANSI color
          codes (SGR, \e[...m) and ignore non-color ANSI escape codes.

        - [Bugfix] Add pruning of ANSI color codes so multiple replacement using
          ta_substr() will not become increasingly slower due to proliferation
          of unpruned color codes (due to ta_trunc()).

        - [Bugfix] Make ta_wrap work without Text::WideChar::Util (previously,
          ta_wrap always uses regex patterns from Text::WideChar::Util despite
          $is_mb is 0).

        - [Bugfix] Fix regex pattern for ANSI color codes (previous one was too
          broad).

        - Add (currently minimal) bench devscript.


0.18    2015-08-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add functions: ta_substr, ta_mbsubstr.


0.17    2015-08-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Make Text::WideChar::Util an optional prereq.

        - Also provide Text::ANSI::WideUtil and the leaner
          Text::ANSI::NonWideUtil (the latter doesn't load Unicode modules, use
          this if you do not have Unicode/wide characters in your text).


0.16    2015-01-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Rebuild (Generate TODO.md).


0.15    2014-02-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - ta_mbwrap(): Fix small wrapping bug (whitespace before line-broken CJK
          word was omitted).


0.14    2014-02-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - ta_mbwrap(): Long CJK words were not line-broken exhaustively.


0.13    2014-02-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - ta_mbwrap(): Add support for wrapping Chinese/CJK text.


0.12    2013-10-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Rebuild to resolve 'nested encoding' problem
          causing MetaCPAN to fail to index the dist (thanks Shantanu Bhadoria).


0.11    2013-09-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Replace Text::CharWidth's mbswidth() with Text::WideChar::Util's
          mbswidth(), which in turn uses Unicode::GCString. It's about 2.5x
          slower but more proper and builds on my Windows installation.


0.10    2013-05-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add return_stats option to ta_{mb,}wrap.


0.09    2013-05-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - ta_{mb,}wrap(): truncated long word did not retain color at the last
          line.


0.08    2013-04-19  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add functions: ta_extract_codes, ta_add_color_resets,
          ta_length_height.

        - ta_highlight{,all}: $needle can now be a Regexp.

        - ta_{,mb}wrap: Reimplement, now behavior similar to
          Text::WideChar::Util's {,mb}wrap().

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - ta_highlight{,_all}: Remove argument $ci, now use qr/foo/i as $needle
          for case-insensitive highlighting.


0.07    2013-04-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Add functions: ta_split_codes_single, ta_highlight, ta_highlight_all.


0.06    2013-04-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - ta_mbtrunc(): Use mbtrunc() which is the proper method, instead of
          substr().

        - ta_mbpad(): Since ta_mbtrunc() might generate text with width of
          ($width-1) or less, depending on the width of the truncated wide
          character, we need to pad the truncated text to go to $width.


0.05    2013-04-09  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - ta_{,mb}pad() now does not handle multiline text (the implementation
          was incorrect after all, "" should've been padded to "xxx" and "a\n"
          should've been padded to "axx\nxxx"). You can now split multiline text
          by yourself as you see fit.


0.04    2013-04-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [BUG FIXES]

        - ta_{,mb}wrap(): Handles multiple paragraph, fix bug where last word of
          text is sometimes removed, do not remove terminating newline.


0.03    2013-04-06  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add functions: ta_split_codes, ta_{,mb}trunc, ta_{,mb}pad.


0.02    2013-03-20  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Fix failing CT reports by skipping tests on systems without Chinese
          locale support.


0.01    2013-03-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - First release.
