Revision history for Text-ANSI-Util

0.06    2013-04-09 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - ta_mbtrunc(): Use mbtrunc() which is the proper method, instead of
          substr().

        - ta_mbpad(): Since ta_mbtrunc() might generate text with width of
          ($width-1) or less, depending on the width of the truncated wide
          character, we need to pad the truncated text to go to $width.


0.05    2013-04-09 (SHARYANTO)

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - ta_{,mb}pad() now does not handle multiline text (the implementation
          was incorrect after all, "" should've been padded to "xxx" and "a\n"
          should've been padded to "axx\nxxx"). You can now split multiline text
          by yourself as you see fit.


0.04    2013-04-08 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - ta_{,mb}wrap(): Handles multiple paragraph, fix bug where last word of
          text is sometimes removed, do not remove terminating newline.
